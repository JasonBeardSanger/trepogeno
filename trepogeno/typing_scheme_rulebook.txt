Mykrobe has some very specific rules when it comes to desgining a typing scheme which can cause some difficulties.

A normal typing scheme will look like this;

```
ref	6442	A	G	DNA	TPA.2
ref	6654	T	C	DNA	TPE
ref	6740	A	G	DNA	*TPA.1.6
```

The first column but be ref
The second column is the location base pair 
The third column is the base found in the reference, the reference allele
The fourth column is the base found alternatively, the alternative allele
The fith column is lineage in which a given SNP is found

A * must be used for lineages in which the reference genome belongs, as can be seen in the above example.
Normally mykrobe assumes a lineage is defined my the presence of the alternative allele.
The * tells mykrobe the lineage is instead defined by the presence of the reference allele.

Additioanlly you can not have a SNP at a base descriminate for multiple lineages at the same level.
For example, this is an invalid scheme:
```
ref	4800	C	A	DNA	TPA.2.7
ref	4800	C	A	DNA	TPA.2.9
```
Becuase mykrobe creates a key value pair from the base and change like this C4800A:TPA.2.9
it doesn't natively support multile of the same keys.
if you try to have a change at the same base be representitive for select lineage of the same level mykrobe will only create on key the others will be discarded.

Finally you must ensure that your scheme has defined SNPS for every level of your hierarchy.
If you wanted to define SNPS for the lineages TPA.2.7 and TPE.3.1 like so:
```
ref	213784	A	G	DNA	TPA.2.7
ref	251918	G	A	DNA	TPA.2.7
ref	266587	T	C	DNA	TPE.3.1
ref	470932	C	T	DNA	TPE.3.1
```

Then you MUST also include SNPS in your scheme for TPA, TPA.2, TPE, and TPE.3 like so:

```
ref	20770	A	G	DNA	TPA
ref	6442	A	G	DNA	TPA.2
ref	88317	T	C	DNA	TPE.3
ref	90092	G	T	DNA	TPE
```

If mykrobe is unable to find at least some support for all three level of this hierarchy it won't call it
